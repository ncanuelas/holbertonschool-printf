_printf Function

The _printf function is a custom implementation of the printf function in C, which allows printing formatted output to the standard output (usually the console). The function provides support for various format specifiers, such as %d for integers, %s for strings, %c for characters, %u for unsigned integers, %x and %X for hexadecimal, %o for octal, and %% for the percent symbol, among others.
Usage

c

#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

To use the _printf function, include "main.h" and call it with a format string as the first argument, followed by any additional arguments required by the format specifiers in the format string.
Format Specifiers

The following format specifiers are supported by the _printf function:

    %c: Character - Prints a single character.
    %s: String - Prints a null-terminated string.
    %d or %i: Integer - Prints a signed decimal integer.
    %u: Unsigned Integer - Prints an unsigned decimal integer.
    %x and %X: Hexadecimal - Prints an unsigned integer in hexadecimal (lowercase or uppercase, respectively).
    %o: Octal - Prints an unsigned integer in octal.
    %%: Percent - Prints a percent symbol.

Examples

c

int main(void)
{
    int len;
    int len2;
    unsigned int ui;
    void *addr;

    len = _printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
    len2 = printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
    ui = (unsigned int)INT_MAX + 1024;
    addr = (void *)0x7ffe637541f0;
    _printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len, len);
    printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len2, len2);
    _printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -762534);
    printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -762534);
    _printf("Unsigned:[%u]\n", ui);
    printf("Unsigned:[%u]\n", ui);
    _printf("Unsigned octal:[%o]\n", ui);
    printf("Unsigned octal:[%o]\n", ui);
    _printf("Unsigned hexadecimal:[%x, %X]\n", ui, ui);
    printf("Unsigned hexadecimal:[%x, %X]\n", ui, ui);
    _printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
    printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
    _printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
    printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
    _printf("Address:[%p]\n", addr);
    printf("Address:[%p]\n", addr);
    len = _printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
    len2 = printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
    _printf("Len:[%d]\n", len);
    printf("Len:[%d]\n", len2);
    _printf("Unknown:[%r]\n");
    printf("Unknown:[%r]\n");
    return (0);
}

The above code demonstrates various uses of the _printf function and how it compares to the standard printf function.
